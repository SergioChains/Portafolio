Comandos, pasos y evidencia de CIS Benchmark en ParrotHome
Primero se utiliza el comando: 
--> curl https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.sh |sudo bash -s -- -P inspec
se le  da enter e ingresa  la contraseña del superusuario
Cuando se tiene el inspect para debian, se clonara el repositorio del CIS que se utilizara
utilizamos el comando: 
--> git clone https://github.com/dev-sec/cis-dil-benchmark
una vez descargado necesitaremos utilizar el comando:
--> sudo inspec exec cis-dil-benchmark
Se necesitara tener una cuenta de Chef Inspect para utilizar el repositorio, 
Se ingresara el ID de licencia en donde la terminal lo pide y se da enter para comenzar 
a aplicar el CIS de Benchmark:
